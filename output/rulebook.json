When there is no 'race' for the puck on an icing, icing will not be called until a Defending player (excluding the Goaltender) crosses the threshold of defending zone face-off spot(s) and the puck has completely crossed the goal line. ii. Should there be a 'race' for the puck during an icing, there are two (2) judgements a Linesperson must make when applying the 'hybrid-icing' rule. (1) First, the Linesperson's must determine if the puck will in fact cross the goal line in the attacking zone. If it is determined that the puck will NOT cross the goal line then the icing will be waved off. However, if it is determined that the puck will cross the goal line the Linesperson should proceed to the second judgment for hybrid-icing. (2) The Linesperson's second judgment is to determine whether a defending skater or attacking skater would be first to potentially touch the puck after crossing the goal line. This decision must be made no later than the instant the first of the players crosses the threshold of the end zone faceoff spot(s), although the decision may be made earlier. If a defending skater is determined to be the first player to potentially touch the puck, then hybrid-icing will be called and play should be stopped. If an Attacking skater is determined to be the first to potentially touch the puck, then hybrid icing will be waved off and play will continue. Note 1: Should icing be called, the Linesperson that stops play should blow the whistle and then raise their non-whistle arm to indicate that icing has occurred. iii. Should the puck be shot or propelled in such a manner that it travels around the boards or bounces off the end zone boards (behind the goal line), the Linesperson must determine which player would be potentially first to touch the puck, under these new conditions. If the puck comes above the goal line, the Linesperson will not stop play unless a defending player is the first to actually touch the puck. If the attacking team is first to touch the puck, the icing will be waved off. iv. If a race for the puck is too close to determine which player would potentially touch the puck first, then hybrid-icing must be called. Linespersons must err on the side of player safety with close plays, in the favour of stopping play for icing. v. During a hybrid-icing situation where play has been stopped, there must be strict enforcement of rules regarding avoidable contact between players, leading up to or after the icing call has been made. Referees must penalize unnecessary contact. vi. If a Goaltender leaves their crease with both skates, moving in the direction of the puck, the Linesperson will wave off the hybrid-icing. However, if the Goaltender is out of the crease prior to icing being initiated (e.g. retrieving a stick or leaving for an extra attacker etc.) and the Goaltender skates back toward their crease, the hybrid-icing will remain in effect."
